## Quick Start (uv)

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python dependency management.

Install uv (one time):
```
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Create / sync the virtual environment (includes dev tools like pre-commit):
```
uv sync --group dev
```

Run the index builder:
```
uv run python scripts/build_index.py
```

Run all pre-commit hooks manually:
```
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

Activate automatic hooks on commit:
```
uv run pre-commit install
```

Regenerate the index before committing if you added or renamed prompt files.
